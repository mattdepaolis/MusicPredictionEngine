## Summary
The primary objective of this project is to improve the efficiency of user recommendations in Deezer by implementing a recommender system. To achieve this goal, the proposed solution involves the adoption of the LightFM recommender system for music recommendations. LightFM utilizes a hybrid approach, combining content-based and collaborative filtering techniques, to provide users with relevant suggestions.
